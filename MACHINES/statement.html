<h1>Artist statement</h1>

    The motive behind my work is my interest in how various artifacts with which we come into 
    contact every day function and evolve, how our perception of them and our interaction with 
    them affect us, and to what extent the interpretable and non-interpretable symbols we use 
    are part of these objects, part of our research on the objects, or independent entities.


    What is it that immediately makes us understand that an object or construct is not naturally 
    occurring but artificial? What is the boundary, if it exists, between a "simple" object, a 
    machine, and a work of art? And how much can one play with this boundary?


    In this research, I assume that everything starts as materials that are transformed into
     objects, which then morph into machines. And when these machines reach a level of high 
     complexity and interpretive symbol manipulation capabilities, perhaps a kind of animism is 
     achieved. I also hypothesize that each step along this timeline "animates" the object more 
     and more. Then, I try to position my work within this spectrum.

     In my attempt to answer these questions, I construct my own machines, combining organic 
     and geometric elements. I invent and redefine my own symbols and give my machines 
     functions that are not aimed at being functional but exist solely to be studied as entities. I 
     use electronic circuits and code to achieve these functions, which I don't see as something 
     separate from the object itself. On the contrary, I consider them part of the object, as the 
     manipulation of interpretable symbols is a characteristic that an object acquires throughout 
     its timeline, as mentioned before.

     I strive for the machines I create to resemble games because I believe that the process of 
     play is the most effective way we have as creatures to experience and explore the world 
     around us. By giving my works this form, I hope to attract viewers to touch and examine them 
     instead of merely standing and looking at them passively. I also hope that through this 
     interaction, the viewer will be able to see these objects as I see them, living entities that 
     inhabit space and evolve through time, rather than lifeless static existences.
